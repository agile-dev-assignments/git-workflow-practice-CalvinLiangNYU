[N-API: Next generation APIs for Node.js native addons available across all LTS release lines](https://sweetcode.io/api-nodejs-native-addons-lts-release-line/)

## What was interesting
Javascript
Node.js is a back-end Javascript runtime environment that has allowed the creation of web-apps written in only one programming language, Javascript. The use of Javascript for both front-end and back-end developement of web-apps streamlines the development process, but because Javascript is an interpreted language, it is not as performant as native code. The N-API for Node.js addresses this performance concern of mine by allowing native modules to be used with Node.js. Javascript is not very well suited for computationally heavy tasks, so the offloading of these tasks to native modules means more efficient use of hardware. Node.js is an essential part of modern web-apps, so it is good to see that the workflow improvements provided by Node.js does not necessarily mean performance must suffer.
